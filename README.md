# Patio
Patio is an integrated solution that tries to solve the problem, mobility students face (primarily) searxhing for the suitable short term accomodation abroad. Major problems are the lack of available apartments, the distrust based on the communication limitations and frequnet scam profiles and offers. We try to tackle these programs with a website and mobile application that provides a database with tracking options to provide options months in advance, in-site chat with translator bot and bilingual contract, and a social space, where costumers can find their possible future flatmates not only their accomodation, thus making their stay a positive expirience with a higher chance, spent with people they share their interests with.
